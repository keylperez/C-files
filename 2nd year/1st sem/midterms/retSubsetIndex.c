// Write the code for the function retSubsetIndex. The function will receive as parameters 2 arrays and their respective sizes. The 1st array will act as a dataset to be searched, while the 2nd array will serve as the querying action. The function will check the 1st array for each element in the 2nd array. If the element is found, store in a 3rd array the first index where the element was found. If the element was not found, store a -1 instead. Return the 3rd array to the calling function.

// 1) Write the function prototype for function retSubsetIndex.
// 2) Write the appropriate function call, assuming the function is called in main. Declare all the necessary variables to be passed to the calling function.
// 3) Write the body of the function retSubsetIndex.
// 4) Draw the execution stack.

// Example:
// A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
// B[] = {2, 8, 3};
// C[] = {1, -1, 2};

// A[] = {31, 15, 2, 1, 15};
// B[] = {15, 33, 17, 2, 1};
// C[] = {1, -1, -1, 2, 3};
